# Getting Started with Create React App
### Online Grosery Shop
This is my first full stack application.

## Objectives of my website: 
There are some cards in the home page. In each card there are food image, title, price and a button named Add Product. You can buy a product by clicking this button. Then it will take to you the another router, there you will see more information about the product. 
If you are willing to buy the product then you click on the buy now button and you can select you buying date. 
Then the checkout will be proceed. 

## For Creating this website I use html, css, bootstrap, react, express, mongodb, nodejs.

# I deploy my client side in the firebase and server side in heroku.
